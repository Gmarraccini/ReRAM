Tensorflow code for Simulation of 3bit integer Neural network

This python code requires the installation of Tensorflow, numpy and pylab. All can be installed by pip command or are already preinstalled.
When the script is run, it is possible to load the already present file "Mk8I20H20.keras" for an already trained network working with 3bit and a simple dataset for inference. Otherwise, if the imput 'n' is given, a new model will be trained.
